# ‚ö° EVis ‚Äì Electric Field Visualizer

**Author:** Nikola Peric

EVis is an interactive educational tool designed to help visualize electric fields generated by point charges. The application provides a simple and intuitive interface where users can place protons and electrons on a 2D plane, and observe the resulting electric field vectors.

## üéØ Project Goal

To create a visual learning aid for physics and engineering students by:

- Allowing the user to place **protons** and **electrons** on a 2D grid.
- Displaying the **electric field vectors** as arrows.
  - **Direction** of each arrow represents the direction of the electric field.
  - **Opacity** of each arrow corresponds to the field's magnitude.

```

### ü™ü Windows (MinGW + Ninja)
```bash

git clone https://github.com/NikolaPeric286/EVis
cd EVis
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++
ninja
cd ../output
./evis.exe
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure SFML libraries are correctly placed in external/SFML-Windows/ with proper include/, lib/, and bin/ folders. See the documentation for more details.
